Now, I know I agreed to make this rocket for you... for free might I add. I'm only doing all this because I know how much you like SpaceGirl. # speaker: Spacedoc
But I'm going to need some things from you if you want to see SpaceGirl! Each day, I'll collect everything that you extract from the world. # speaker: Spacedoc
 # speaker: Spacedoc
But if you don't get everything I need in time, this rocket won't be built. I never said I was a rocket scientist... anyways get on it! # speaker: Spacedoc
Head on south through and into the wild! Time is ticking... # speaker: Spacedoc

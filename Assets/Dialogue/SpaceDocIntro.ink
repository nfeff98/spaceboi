Now, I know I agreed to make this rocket for you... for free might I add. # speaker: Spacedoc
But I'm going to need some things from you if you want to see SpaceGirl! # speaker: Spacedoc
I'm only doing all this because I know how much you like that her. # speaker: Spacedoc
But if you don't get everything I need in time, this rocket won't be built. I'm not a rocket scientist... anyways get on it! # speaker: Spacedoc
